# Godot-Turn-Based-Battle-System-3D
Uses Godot 4.3. Written in GDScript.

#Dependency Notice
This project uses PhantomCamera, which can be downloaded from the Godot AssetLib or at its [GitHub](https://github.com/ramokz/phantom-camera).

All battle scenes will inherit from the BattleBase scene, TestBattle being the scene to demonstrate battles.


In the battle scene, put any player characters under Heroes, and enemies under Enemies. The BattleManager will automatically grab them and put them in appropirate arrays.
